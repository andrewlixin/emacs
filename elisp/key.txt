*Selective Display

     (`beginning-of-defun').


C-M-e end-of-defun

C-M-h Put region around whole current or following defun (mark-defun)
  Put region around whole current or following defun (`mark-defun').

M-; Insert or align comment (indent-for-comment)
You can also use `Meta-;' to align an existing comment.  If a line
already contains the string that starts comments, `M-;' just moves
point after it and re-indents it to the conventional place.
Even when an existing comment is properly aligned, `M-;' is still
useful for moving directly to the start of the comment.

M-( Put paren around next sexp(s) insert-parentheses
M-) move-past-close-and-reindent

`C-u - C-x ;' (`kill-comment') kills the comment on the current
line, if there is one.
